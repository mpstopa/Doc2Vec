We enable programmatic innovation. Iterate built a patented low-code platform(Interplay) with 475 pre-built connectors (enterprise, AI, IoT, Blockchain etc). It's used as middleware and as a rapid application platform by big companies like Circle K, Ulta Beauty, Driven Brands, Pampered Chef, and others. As a middleware, it operates Pay-by-Plate (frictionless payments at the gas pump) in Europe, Weapons Detection (to predict robberies), AI-based Chat, online personalization for commerce sites, computer vision applications for damage estimation, and much more. It also helps companies do digital prototyping 10X to 17X faster than old ways. We're growing pretty fast without funding support, marketing, or sales efforts.

We believe, and so does everyone else, quite frankly, that when regulations finally show up, many bad habits are going to have been created inside of the industry. What we set out to do was provide good habits. A way to track seed certifications, THC tests, transporations chains of custodies, and proof of origins for the entire industry. This way, when regulations do show up, the right habits are already being practiced, and no lag time for compliance is needed.
